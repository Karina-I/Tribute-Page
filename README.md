# Tribute-Page 
It's my first basic Front End Development Project.
  
    
  I build this website as a project of FreeCodeCamp. And it's a tribute to the entire Indian Classical Dance that I have been practicing since I was 7 year old.  
  
  
In this website I've a simple HTML & CSS file. Just for practicing the how to work with different tags of HTML and how to style them .
