	<header><h1>Kathak</h1></header>	


	<main>Kathak is derived from the Sanskrit word katha meaning story and Kathakars meaning the one who tells a story. Kathak traces its origins to the nomadic bards of ancient northern India who used to recite religious and mythological tales using mime and dance accompanied by musician. Kathak started in temples in Northern India and later transited to Mogul court during the Mogul era. This is the only classical dance form that has links with Hindu and Muslim culture.

	The pirouettes are the most distinguished feature of Kathak, the technique is built by the use of an intricate use of foot-work, soft gliding movements of the neck, eyebrows and the wrists.

	Recitation of the rhythmic syllables is common; the dancer often pauses to recite these to a specified metrical cycle of 16, 10, 14 beats followed by execution through movement. Both the drummer (often a tabla player) and the dancer weave endless combinations on a repetitive melodic line.

	The beats are called differently by the names tukra, tora, and parana, all indicative of the nature of rhythmic patterns used and the percussion instrument accompanying the dance. The dance often commences with a sequence called Thaat. This is followed by a conventional formal entry known as the Amad (entry) and the Salami (salutation).

	There are three major schools or gharana of Kathak: the Lucknow gharana, known for the expression of moods and emotions, Jaipur gharana famous for its rhythmic virtuosity and Varanasi gharana, which is characterized by the exclusive use of the Natwari or dance bols, which are different from the tabla and the pakhawaj bols. There is also a great use of the floor. These schools are named according to the geographical area in which they were developed and each gharana has a slight difference in interpretation and repertoire.</main>

		<header><h1>Bharatnatyam</h1></header>

		<main>Bharatanatyam, also spelled as Bharata Natyam, is one of the oldest classical dance forms that originated in the temples of Tamil Nadu in South India. Meaning of the word Bharatanatyam is derived from “Bhavam” means expression, “ragam” meaning music, “talam” meaning rhythm and natyam meaning dance. This dance form was codified by Sanskrit Scholar Bharata Muni in Natya Shastra, an ancient Indian treatise on the performing arts, encompassing theatre, dance and music.

		The dance movements in Bharatanatyam are characterized by Aramandi or Ardhamandala, a position similar to a plié in ballet (knee bend position), combined with expressive hand gestures and elaborate facial expressions used in storytelling.

		Bharatanatyam involves 3 aspects to dance; Nritta, Nritya and Natya.

		Nritta is a pure dance without any emotions or expressions. It involves rhythmic dance were movements of the body do not convey any mood or meaning.
		Nritya involves emotions and expressions, where the lyrics of the song are conveyed using hand gestures (hasta mudras) and facial expressions (abhinaya).
		Natya means dramatic representation or drama with speech, music and dancing. Natya is combination of Nritta & Nritya.</main>

		<header><h1>Odissi</h1></header>
		<main>This classical dance form originates from the eastern state of Orissa in India. According to archaeological evidences, it is the oldest surviving dance form of India. This dance form is referred as Odra-Magadhi in Natya Shastra, the classic treatise of Indian dance.

		Odissi was initially performed in the temples as a religious offering by the Maharis (temple girls) who dedicated their lives in the services of God. It has the closest resemblance with sculptures of the Indian temples

		Some of the most distinguishing features of Odissi dance are the Tribhangi, which involves movement of head, chest and torso and Chauka or Chouka, the basic square position that symbolises Lord Jagannath. These poses are more curved than other classical Indian dances. Mudra is also an important component of Odissi dance. The term Mudra means stamp, and is a hand position which suggests a wide array of symbolism and emotion. Odissi themes are most often religious in nature, and many revolve around expressing the stories of Lord Krishna.

		Odissi is characterised by various stances known as Bhangas, which involves stamping of the foot and striking various postures as seen in Indian sculptures. The common Bhangas are Bhanga, Abanga, Atibhanga and Tribhanga.</main>

		<header><h1>Bangladeshi Folk Dance</h1></header>
		<main> Bangladesh has a rich tradition of folk songs, with lyrics rooted in vibrant tradition and spirituality, mysticism, and devotion. Such folk songs revolve around other themes, including love. The most prevalent folk songs and music traditions include Bhatiali, Baul, Marfati, Murshidi, and Bhawaiya. Lyricists like Lalon Shah, Hason Raja, Kangal Harinath, Romesh Shill, Abbas Uddin, and many unknown anonymous lyricists have enriched the tradition of folk songs of Bangladesh.
		
		In a relatively modern context, Robindro Shongit and Nazrul Giti form precious cultural heritage of Bangladesh. Recently, western influences have given rise to quality rock bands, particularly in urban centres like Dhaka. Several musical instruments, some of them indigenous, are used in Bangladesh, and major musical instruments used are the bamboo flute (bashi), drums (dhol), a single stringed instrument named ektara, a four-stringed instrument called dotara, and a pair of metal bawls used for rhythm effect called mandira, are important in the culture of Bangladesh. Currently,musical instruments of western origin like guitars, drums, and the saxophone are used, sometimes along with traditional instruments (Muajj).</main>
